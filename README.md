# Genome Forecast
    A program designed to receive DNA sequences and simulate mutations to it.

## What exactly does Genome Forecast do?
Genome Forecast will receive one or more DNA sequences, determined in a .fasta file, and input from the user, asking for day-to-day habits that could cause cancer, the frequency of those habits, and the intensity. With that information, it will simulate mutations in the DNA sequence and give the user how many mutations their habits could cause, thus giving the user an estimated chance of them developing a tumor.

## Features (WIP)
<li> Input from the user and the processing of the data given by the user
<li> Reading the FASTA file and separating it into ID, description, sequence and number of bases
